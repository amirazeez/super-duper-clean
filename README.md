# super-duper-clean
When it comes to data science, all we hear is that homo-sapiens spend about 60~70% of their time in cleaning the dataset. Well here is one such instance where you can use this very simple code.
What does this code do??

        1.create a column
        2.parse the loaded csv
        3.find and extract the said pattern(regular expression)
        4.print the new column
        5.convert the newly created data frame into csv 
        6.data is stored in the working directory
